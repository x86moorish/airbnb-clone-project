## üõ¢Ô∏è Database Design

### Key Entities and Fields:

- **User**
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `email`
  - `password`
  - `first_name`
  - `last_name`
  
- **Property**
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `owner_id` (Foreign Key to User)
  - `title`
  - `description`
  - `price_per_night`
  - `location`
  
- **Booking**
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `property_id` (Foreign Key to Property)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key to User)
  - `check_in`
  - `check_out`
  - `total_price`
  
- **Payment**
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `booking_id` (Foreign Key to Booking)
  - `payment_date`
  - `amount`
  - `payment_status`
  
- **Review**
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key to User)
  - `property_id` (Foreign Key to Property)
  - `rating`
  - `comment`
  - `created_at`

### Relationships:

- A **User** can have multiple **Properties**.
- A **Booking** belongs to a **User** and a **Property**.
- A **Payment** is associated with a single **Booking**.
- A **Review** links a **User** to a **Property** and provides a rating and comment.

  - CD (Continuous Deployment) automatically deploys successful code changes to production or staging environments.

- **Why is it important?**
  - Detects bugs early.
  - Speeds up the deployment process.
  - Ensures consistent and reliable releases.

- **Tools Used**:
  - **GitHub Actions**: For running tests and deployments automatically.
  - **Docker**: For building containers during CI/CD processes.
  - **Docker Compose**: To manage multi-container applications in different environments.
